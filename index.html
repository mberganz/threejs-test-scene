      // Create scene, camera and renderer, so we can render the scene with camera
      // Scene
      const scene = new THREE.Scene();
      // Camera
      const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
        // Field of View (FOV)
        75,
        // Aspect Ratio (Window Width / Window Height)
        window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
        // Near (Objects closer than this won't be rendered)
        0.1,
        // Far (Objects further away than this won't be rendered)
        1000
        // Near and Far objects can affect performance
      );
      // Renderer
      const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
      // Set the size at which the app will be rendered
      // It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app (Window Width, Window Height)
      renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
      // In order to boost performance you can also set the size to smaller values, like: window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2; which will make the app render at a quarter size
      // If you wish to keep the size of your app but render it at a lower resolution using the third argument "false" on the setSize function, like: setSize(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2, false); which will render the app at half resolution

      // Add the Renderer element to our HTML document
      // This is a <canvas> element the renderer uses to display the scene
      document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

      // Create a cube
      // Cube
      // This is an object that contains all the points (vertices) and fill (faces) of the cube
      const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
      // Material
      // All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to the geometry
      // Different materials also affect the way light bounces on them
      // Color it using hex colors (0x00ff00 is green), this works the same way that colors work in CSS or Photoshop
      const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
      // Mesh
      // A mesh is an object that takes a geometry, and applies a material to it, which we then can insert to our scene, and move freely around
      const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
      // By default, when we call scene.add(), the thing we add will be added to the coordinates (0,0,0).
      scene.add(cube);
      // This would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside each other. To avoid this, we simply move the camera out a bit
      camera.position.z = 5;

      // Rendering the scene
      // This will create a loop that causes the renderer to draw the scene every time the screen is refreshed (on a typical 60hz screen this means 60 times per second)
      function animate() {
        // requestAnimationFrame has a number of advantages. Perhaps the most important one is that it pauses when the user navigates to another browser tab, hence not wasting their precious processing power and battery life
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        // Animating the cube
        // This will be run every frame and give the cube a nice rotation animation
        // Anything you want to move or change while the app is running has to go through the animate loop
        // You can of course call other functions from there, so that you don't end up with an animate function that's hundreds of lines
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
        // This will render the scene and the camera
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
      }
      // Calls the function animate() and starts the animation
      animate();
